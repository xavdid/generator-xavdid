## The Why

I've been writing a bunch of typescript and had gotten frustrated after setting up the same few tools, build steps, and testing frameworks repeatedly. So, I set up a generator to scaffold out projects just how I like them. Feel free to use it if you want to write typescript code using the same starting setup as I do!

Built on the awesome shoulders of [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and `generator-xavdid` using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-xavdid
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo xavdid
```
