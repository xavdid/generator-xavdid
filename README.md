## The Why

I've been writing a bunch of typescript and had gotten frustrated after setting up the same few tools, build steps, and testing frameworks repeatedly. So, I set up a generator to scaffold out projects just how I like them. Feel free to use it if you want to write typescript code using the same starting setup as I do!

Built on the awesome shoulders of [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and `generator-xavdid` using the tool of your choice.

```bash
yarn global add yo generator-xavdid
```

Then, generate your new project:

```bash
yo xavdid
```

## Development

Most of the work will take place in `app/index.ts`, to focus there!

To test the unreleased version, run `yo ../path/to/this/folder`
